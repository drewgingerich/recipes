## Recipe

Heat a large pot on high. Add oil and wait until hot.

Saute onions until carmalized, about 5 min.

Add Garlic and briefly saute until fragrant.

Add remaining ingredients, except meat and vinegar (we don't want to dilute their flavor). Simmer for 30 minutes, until beans are cooked and chili is thick.

Add vinegar and meat. Simmer for a few mintes and then take off heat.

Serve with sour cream and parsely garnish.

## Notes

Try subbing the chile powder with 1 cup of your favorite spicy sauce!
