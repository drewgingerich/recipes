# Candied Citrus Peel

## Ingredients

| Name         | Amount     |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| sugar        | 2 cups     |
| citrus fruit | 1 cup peel |

## Recipe

- Slice top and bottom off of citrus fruits
- Score peel vertically, from top to bottom
- Remove peel in strips
- Blanche peel by boiling it in water for 5 minutes, and then draining the water
- Repeat blanching until bitterness is gone, around 2 times for orange, 3-4 times for lemon, and 5-6 times for grapefruit
- Put enough water in the pot to cover the peel---but don't add the peel yet---and add an equal number of cups of sugar
- Boil and stir sugar water until sugar dissolves and mixture turns clear
- Add citrus peel and boil until soft and the pith turns translucent
- Strain to remove citrus peel and lay on a baking sheet to dry

## Notes

- The sugar water used to candy the citrus peel becomes a nice citrus simple syrup
- As water is lost from the sugar water mixture, reduce the heat to avoid burning the sugar
