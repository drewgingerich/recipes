Hachiya persimmons ripen slowly and unpredictable, and are the limiting factor.
I recommend buying a few, and basing the quantities of the other ingredients on how much puree they yield.

I also recommend pureeing the persimmons as they ripen and refridgerating or freezing the puree until enough are processed.
A ripe hachiya persimmon feels like a sac of goo.

## Notes to self

Try without any added sugar. The persimmon ends up already quite sweet!

This pudding is a bit too soft.
Try [this recipe](https://www.portercalls.com/thompson%27s_persimmon_pudding.htm), which has more egg and less milk.
