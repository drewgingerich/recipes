Hachiya persimmons ripen slowly and unpredictable, and are the limiting factor.
I recommend buying a few, and basing the quantities of the other ingredients on how much puree they yield.

I also recommend pureeing the persimmons as they ripen and refridgerating or freezing the puree until enough are processed.
A ripe hachiya persimmon feels like a sac of goo.
