# Notes

- Sub peanuts -> cashews or pine nuts.
- Sub fresno chile -> any small-ish chile. Choose based on spicy preference.
- Ingredient amounts don't have to be exact.
- Can use 2-3x more fish sauce if you like it.
- Flavor improves over time. The celery in particular absorbs the dressing nicely.
