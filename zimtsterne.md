# Lazy Zimtsterne

Chewy spiced almond cookies, similar in texture to a macaron shell.
They are based on a German holiday cookie named zimtsterne (cinammon star),
but I'm too lazy to cut out the individual stars so I bake them as a sheet and cut them into squares instead.

## Ingredients

| Name                     | Amount     |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Egg whites               | 3          |
| Powdered sugar           | 2 cups     |
| Almond flour, extra fine | 3 1/4 cups |
| Cinnamon                 | 1 tbsp     |
| Vanilla extract          | 1 tbsp     |
| Salt                     | 1/8 tsp    |

Other spices can be used instead of cinnamon,
such as ginger, cardamom, or anise.
Adjust the amount of spice for its relative strength.

## Recipe

1. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks
2. Sift powdered sugar and fold in gently
3. In second bowl, mix almond flour, cinnamon, vanilla extract and salt
4. Gently fold almond flour mix into egg whites
5. Place dough in the fridge until firm, around 30 minutes
6. Preheat the oven to 250 F
7. Line a baking sheet (or several, depending on size) with parchment paper and dust with powdered sugar
8. Place dough on baking sheet and roll out to 1/4 inch
9. Bake on the bottom shelf for 20 minutes
10. Let cool overnight and then cut into squares

If cookie is sticking to the parchment paper after baking, you can cook it for longer to help the bottom crisp up and release more easily.

These cookies get much firmer and chewier over time.
