## Ingredients

| Name             | Amount     |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Egg whites       | 2          |
| Powdered sugar   | 1 1/2 cups |
| Fine lmond flour | 2 cups     |
| Cinnamon         | 1 tsp      |
| vanilla extract  | 1 tsp      |

## Recipe

1. Separate the eggs and beat the egg whites in a medium-sized bowl until stiff. The egg white is stiff enough when you can turn over the bowl and the egg white doesn’t move.
   - 2 egg whites
2. Sift in the powdered sugar and fold it in carefully with a spatula. Remove approximately 3 tablespoons of the mixture and set it aside in a small bowl.
   - 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
3. Add the ground almonds, cinnamon, and vanilla extract into the bowl and mix carefully with your spatula. You can use your hands towards the end. If the dough feels very sticky, knead in a little bit more ground almonds.
   - 2 cups ground almonds, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4. Place the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes. This will make it easier when it comes to rolling out the dough in the next step.
5. Preheat the oven to 280 degrees Fahrenheit and line your baking sheets with parchment paper.
6. Place some powdered sugar on the surface and roll out the dough until it is approximately 1/4 inch thick. Cut out the stars with your small star-shaped cookie cutter and set the cookies aside. Dip your cookie cutter into powdered sugar if it sticks to the dough.
7. Gather the leftover dough, form another ball, roll it out again, and cut more cookies until you have used up all the dough.
8. Brush the egg white mixture you set aside earlier on top of the stars with a brush or the tip of a butter knife. Then place the cookies on the baking sheet.
9. Bake the cinnamon stars in the bottom third of the oven for approximately 14-15 minutes. Since every oven is different, your baking time may vary. The white top of the cookies should remain white.
10. Remove the cookies from the oven and place them on a cooling tray. The bottoms of the cookies should still feel slightly soft. They’ll harden a bit more once cooled.
