1. In a large bowl, mix the dressing ingredients
1. Add bulgar and let it soak in the dressing for  around 10 minutes
1. Fold in the salad ingredients

# Notes

- The more fine the bulgar, the better. Large bulgar must be cooked beforehand.
- Consider draining and drying chopped herbs for less soup-y salad.
- Parsley can be finely chopped in a food processor. The rest is recommended to be done by hand.
