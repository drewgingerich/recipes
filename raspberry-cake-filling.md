# Raspberry Cake Filling

## Ingredients

| Name                 | Amount          |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| water                | 1.5 Tablespoons |
| cornstarch           | 1.5 Tablespoons |
| frozen raspberries   | 3 cups          |
| granulated sugar     | 1/3 cup         |
| lemon juice          | 1 teaspoon      |
| pure vanilla extract | 1/2 teaspoon    |

## Recipe

1. Whisk the cornstarch and water together until all the cornstarch has dissolved. (I just use a fork to mix—very easy.) Combine cornstarch mixture, raspberries (no need to thaw if using frozen), granulated sugar, and lemon juice in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. Using a silicone spatula, stir the mixture, mashing the raspberries as they begin to thaw and soften.
2. Bring to a boil and let it boil for 5 full minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove pan from heat and stir in vanilla extract.
3. Allow the raspberry filling to cool at room temperature for 10–15 minutes, then transfer it to a bowl or container and place it in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours and up to 1 week (the longer, the better). No need to cover it; but if refrigerating for longer than 4 hours, cover tightly. It will continue to thicken up as it chills. Raspberry filling must be completely cooled before using in your cake. If freezing, see Note below for instructions.

## Notes

- **Freezing Instructions:** After the raspberry filling cools completely, freeze in a freezer-friendly container for up to 3–6 months. Thaw on the counter or in the refrigerator before using. It will be very thick.
- **What size cake should I make?** This recipe makes a little more than 1 cup of raspberry filling (about 340g). I find it to be just the right amount for a 3-layer 8-inch or 9-inch cake (with 2 layers of raspberry filling). Use a heaping 1/2 cup between each layer. Or you can use it on a 2-layer 8-inch or 9-inch cake, and fit about 3/4 cup in the center; you’ll have some left over. Or try a 3-layer [6-inch cake](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/6-inch-cake-recipes/), pictured today, with about 1/3 cup between each layer.
- **Uses for Leftover Raspberry Cake Filling:** Serve leftover raspberry filling alongside the cake slices or cupcakes. You can also add it to smoothies; stir into yogurt, cottage cheese, or oatmeal; and use as a jam on toast or [scones](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/scones-recipe/).
- **Should I use fresh or frozen raspberries?** I prefer frozen. You can find them year round, they’re always flavorful, and they typically come in 12-ounce bags, which is the exact amount you need in this recipe. You can definitely use the same amount of fresh raspberries if you have them. The end result is pretty much the same.
- **Can I strain out the seeds?** You can, but the raspberry filling doesn’t stay as thick. You’ll need to add at least 1 more teaspoon cornstarch. And you’ll have a lot less filling. I strongly recommend keeping the seeds in the filling.
- **Can I use other berries?** I have only tested this with the same amount of fresh or frozen blackberries, and it works wonderfully. No changes to the recipe, just swap the berries. For a strawberry cake filling, I use and recommend the filling from these [strawberry shortcake cupcakes](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/strawberry-shortcake-cupcakes/). Still working on a blueberry version.
- **Does this work as a topping for cakes and cheesecakes?** It’s quite thick. Instead, I recommend my [raspberry sauce recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/raspberry-dessert-sauce/).
