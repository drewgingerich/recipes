# Notes

- Regular yogurt is fine, but you may have to cut back on milk a bit
- Oat milk works well
- Adding flax meal, etc, makes for a less chewy, more flavorful, and healthier pancrepe
- Taking the pan off the heat a bit before adding batter can help the batter spread thin and even: batter sets very fast on a hot pan
- Add more milk to thin batter and make a thinner pancrepe
- Add less milk to thicken batter and make a thicker and chewier pancrepe
- Adjust amount of batter per pancrepe to match pan size
